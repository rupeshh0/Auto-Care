| Code Editor | CodeMirror 6 (ProjectBlueprint, TechnicalStack), Monaco (mentioned as alternative in ProjectSpecification) | **CodeMirror 6** | Consistently specified as the selected code editor across multiple documents |

## Backend Technologies

| Technology | Inconsistent Versions | Reconciled Version | Justification |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Node.js | v18+ (ProjectBlueprint), 20 LTS (SystemArchitectureDesign, TechnicalStack) | **Node.js 20 LTS** | Using the most recent stable version mentioned |
| npm | v9+ (ProjectBlueprint), not specified in other docs | **npm v9+** | Only version mentioned |
| REST API | v1 endpoints (ProjectBlueprint), not versioned in other docs | **v1 API** | Using the only version mentioned |
| PostgreSQL | Version not specified in any document | **PostgreSQL 14** | Latest stable version at the time of publication |
| Redis | 7.2 Enterprise (TechnicalStack), version not specified in other docs | **Redis 7.2 Enterprise** | Only specific version mentioned |
| Database ORM | Prisma (mentioned across docs, version not specified) | **Prisma (latest stable)** | Consistently mentioned as the ORM |

## DevOps & Infrastructure

| Technology | Inconsistent Versions | Reconciled Version | Justification |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Docker | Version not specified | **Docker (latest stable)** | Consistently mentioned without version |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (mentioned without version) | **GitHub Actions (latest)** | Only CI/CD system mentioned |
| Cloud Provider | DigitalOcean (mentioned across docs) | **DigitalOcean** | Consistently mentioned as primary cloud provider |
| Monitoring | Datadog (mentioned without version) | **Datadog (latest)** | Only comprehensive monitoring solution mentioned |
| Logging | Winston, Pino (mentioned without versions) | **Winston + Pino** | Both mentioned for different logging needs |

## AI & Code Execution

| Technology | Inconsistent Versions | Reconciled Version | Justification |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| AI Models | GPT-3.5, Claude 3.7 (mentioned across docs) | **OpenAI GPT-3.5, Anthropic Claude 3.7** | Consistently mentioned as primary AI models |
| Vector Database | Mentioned without specific technology | **PostgreSQL + pgvector** | Most appropriate for the rest of the stack |
| Container Orchestration | Docker (mentioned across docs) | **Docker + Docker Compose** | Consistently mentioned for container management |
| Code Execution | Secure containers (mentioned across docs) | **Docker with resource limits** | Consistently described approach |

## Mobile Strategy

| Technology | Reconciled Approach | Timeline | Justification |
|------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| Mobile Web | Responsive web design | Q3 2025 | Consistent across documents |
| Progressive Web App | PWA with offline capabilities | Q1 2026 | Consistent across documents |
| Native Apps | React Native for cross-platform | Q4 2026 | Mentioned in multiple documents |
| Mobile Code Editor | CodeMirror 6 with mobile optimizations | Q1 2026 | Selected code editor with planned mobile adaptations |

## Key Technology Decisions

1. **CodeMirror 6 for Code Editor**: Selected over alternatives like Monaco Editor due to its modern architecture, extensibility, performance, and suitability for mobile adaptation. The documentation consistently specifies CodeMirror 6 in both ProjectBlueprint.md and TechnicalStack.md, with concrete implementation examples in SystemArchitectureDesign.md.

2. **Next.js 14.1.0 for Frontend**: The latest version is specified in SystemArchitectureDesign.md and TechnicalStack.md, providing improvements over the "13+" mentioned in ProjectBlueprint.md. This version offers better performance, improved app router, and enhanced SSR capabilities.

3. **Node.js 20 LTS for Backend**: Updated from the "v18+" mentioned in ProjectBlueprint.md to the more recent Node.js 20 LTS specified in SystemArchitectureDesign.md and TechnicalStack.md, providing better performance and longer support window.

4. **Mobile-First Approach**: A phased mobile strategy starting with responsive web design in Q3 2025, progressing to PWA in Q1 2026, and native apps beginning development in Q4 2026.
