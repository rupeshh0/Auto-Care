## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 The Problem

Computer science education, while strong in theoretical foundations and algorithmic problem-solving, systematically fails to equip students with the practical, job-ready skills demanded by modern software engineering roles. This disconnect creates a significant and widening "theory-practice gap," leaving graduates underprepared for the workforce, employers burdened with high training costs, and educational institutions struggling to maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving industry.

Computer science education systematically fails to prepare students for the practical demands of software engineering roles. While academic curricula excel in theoretical foundations and algorithmic problem-solving, they consistently neglect hands-on, job-specific skills that employers require. This disconnect creates a three-way problem: graduates enter the workforce underprepared and anxious, employers face substantial training costs and productivity losses, and educational institutions struggle to maintain relevance in an evolving industry landscape.

> **"I earned As in all my algorithms classes but couldn't deploy a simple API when I started my internship. My team spent two weeks teaching me skills I should have already known, and I felt like an impostor despite my GPA."** — Michael R., CS Graduate, Stanford University

> **"I earned As in all my algorithms classes but couldn't deploy a simple API when I started my internship. My team spent two weeks teaching me skills I should have already known, and I felt like an impostor despite my GPA."** — Michael R., CS Graduate, Stanford University

### 2.2 Key Stakeholders and Their Pain Points

#### 2.2.1 Students

- **Lack of Practical Experience**: Despite academic success, students cannot demonstrate job-ready skills when interviewing or starting roles
- **Career Confidence Gap**: 67% of CS students report feeling "somewhat" or "very" anxious about transitioning from academic to professional environments (LinkedIn Education Survey, 2024)
- **Skill Prioritization Confusion**: Without industry guidance, students struggle to identify which practical skills to develop first
- **Interview Performance Gap**: Many students perform well in academic assessments but falter when faced with practical coding challenges during interviews

> "I received an A in all my theory classes, but when my internship asked me to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a new microservice, I had no idea where to begin. I spent an entire week just trying to understand the basic concepts that weren't covered in any of my courses." — Priya M., Computer Science Junior, University of Michigan

#### 2.2.2 Employers

- **Extended Onboarding Periods**: Average time to productivity for new CS graduates has increased from 3.2 months in 2020 to 4.5 months in 2025 (SHRM Tech Hiring Report, 2025; CompTIA Workforce Trends, 2024)

- **Resource Constraints**: Limited budget, time, and expertise to develop and maintain job-relevant learning environments

> "Our accreditation requirements mandate certain theoretical coursework, but employers want graduates who can deploy secure applications from day one. We're caught between academic standards and industry demands with limited faculty who have recent industry experience." — Dr. Wei Chen, CS Department Chair, State University

#### 2.2.4 Instructors

- **Resource Limitations**: 76% of CS instructors report insufficient resources to teach practical, job-specific skills alongside required curriculum (Computing Research Association Survey, 2024)
- **Outdated Materials**: Rapidly evolving industry practices outpace textbook revisions and course material updates
- **Scale Challenges**: Providing personalized feedback on practical assignments becomes infeasible with growing class sizes
- **Industry Knowledge Gap**: Many instructors lack current industry experience with modern development workflows and tools

> "I know my students need experience with cloud deployment and microservices, but I barely have time to cover the required algorithms coursework, let alone set up complex environments for 200 students to practice these skills." — Professor James Wilson, Teaching Faculty, Georgia Tech

#### 2.2.5 Student Diversity Considerations

- **Learning Style Variations**: Traditional CS education primarily caters to theoretical learners, disadvantaging hands-on, project-based learners who comprise approximately 40% of CS students (Education Research International, 2024)
- **Prior Experience Disparities**: Students from under-resourced schools or non-traditional backgrounds (career changers, self-taught programmers) face a steeper practical skills curve, with 62% reporting feeling "significantly behind" peers with internship experience (CS Education Equity Report, 2025)
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Students with disabilities report limited access to adaptive practical learning resources, with 54% indicating current tools for hands-on learning fail to accommodate their needs (Inclusive Technology Education Survey, 2024)
- **Demographic Impacts**: Women and underrepresented minorities report 15% higher rates of "practical skills anxiety" despite equal or better academic performance (NCWIT State of Women in Tech Report, 2025)

> "As a career-changer with a humanities background, I mastered the theoretical content through determination, but there was no pathway to build the practical skills my classmates with tech internships already had. This created a two-tier system that no amount of studying could overcome." — Jamal T., Non-traditional CS Graduate, University of Washington

## 2.11 The Growing Skills Crisis: A Call to Action

The skills gap between CS education and industry requirements is not merely an inconvenience—it represents a systemic crisis threatening individual careers, business competitiveness, and educational relevance.

This crisis continues to worsen as technology evolves at an accelerating pace, and traditional educational methods struggle to adapt.

**For students**, this gap means starting careers at a disadvantage, facing rejection despite their academic achievements, and spending months or years struggling to gain the practical skills they should have learned during their education.

**For employers**, it means billions in unnecessary training costs, delayed projects, and competitive disadvantages in a technology-driven marketplace.

**For educational institutions**, it means declining relevance, enrollment challenges, and difficulty fulfilling their core mission of preparing students for successful careers.

Without intervention, this gap will continue to widen, creating greater economic inefficiency and wasted potential. The Job-Ready Skill Simulator directly targets this widening gap by providing a structured bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation skills—offering a scalable, accessible solution that educational institutions and self-directed learning platforms have been unable to deliver.

**The time to bridge this gap is now.** Every semester that passes represents thousands of graduates entering the workforce unprepared and billions in economic opportunity cost. By providing guided practice with job-specific tasks and personalized AI feedback, we can transform CS education from theory-focused to practice-ready, benefiting students, employers, and institutions alike.

**This crisis demands a solution that:**

1. Provides hands-on experience with authentic job tasks, not just theoretical exercises
2. Delivers personalized feedback at scale, making quality guidance accessible to all students
3. Continuously adapts to evolving industry requirements
4. Complements traditional education rather than replacing it

The Job-Ready Skill Simulator directly targets this widening gap by creating a bridge between academic knowledge and practical implementation skills—offering a solution that educational institutions, self-directed learning platforms, and industry training programs have been unable to deliver at scale.

Without immediate action, we face a future where the skills gap continues

   ```python
   response = requests.get('http://api.example.com/users', timeout=5)
   ```

2.**Implement basic error handling**:

   ```python
   try:
       response = requests.get('http://api.example.com/users', timeout=5)
       response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception for 4XX/5XX status codes
       return response.json()
   except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
       print(f"Error making API request: {e}")
       return None
   ```

**Example 2: Intermediate-Level SQL Optimization Task**:

```markdown
## Feedback Summary
Your query optimization improves performance by adding an index on the date column. This is a good first step, but we can achieve even better performance by limiting the result set and optimizing the join operation.

## Performance Analysis
Initial query execution time: 4.2 seconds
Your optimized query execution time: 1.8 seconds
Potential after all recommendations: ~0.3 seconds

## Key Optimization Opportunities
1.**Index Creation** ✅ Good job adding the date index!
2.**Result Limiting** ❌ Still retrieving too many rows
3.**Join Strategy** ⚠️ Consider improving the join condition

## Suggested Improvements

**Example 3: Expert-Level Web Security Task**:

```markdown
1.**Limit results** to reduce data transfer:
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 100 s.*
   FROM sales s
   INNER JOIN customers c ON s.id = c.id
   WHERE s.date > '2023-01-01'
   ```

2.**Add a filter condition** to increase index selectivity:

   ```sql
   WHERE s.date > '2023-01-01' AND s.region = 'US'
   ```

3.**Optimize join with additional index**:

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_customers_id ON customers(id);
  ```

#### 4.2.6 Query Plan Analysis

The execution plan shows a table scan on customers, which indicates the join isn't using an index. Adding an index on customers.id would convert this to an index seek operation.

#### 5.1.1 System Architecture

The AI Feedback System follows a microservices architecture, with key components interacting as illustrated below:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph User Interaction
        A[User Submits Code] --> B(Web/Mobile App)
        B --> C{API Gateway}
    end

    subgraph Backend Services
        C --> D[Task Service]
        D --> E[Feedback Service]
        E --> F[AI Model Orchestration Layer]
        F --> G[Prompt Management Service]
        F --> H[Tier 1: Lightweight Models]
        F --> I[Tier 2: Standard Models]
        F --> J[Tier 3: Advanced Models]
        E --> K[Feedback Caching System]
        E --> L[Feedback Processing Pipeline]
        L --> M[Post-Processing & Validation]
    end

    subgraph Data Layer
        D --> N[Database (User Data, Tasks)]
        K --> O[Cache (Redis/Qdrant)]
    end

    subgraph Monitoring
        E --> P[Metrics & Logging]
        F --> P
        K --> P
    end
    
    H -.-> Q[Feedback]
    I -.-> Q
    J -.-> Q
    M --> B
```

**Key Components:**

- **API Gateway:** Entry point for all API requests. Handles routing, authentication (see Section 5.2.1), and rate limiting.
- **Task Service:** Manages task definitions, user submissions, test case execution, and task metadata.

**Prompt Management Service:**

- A centralized service for creating, versioning, and optimizing prompts.
- Provides a RESTful API for retrieving prompts:

  ```
  GET /api/v1/prompts/{taskId}?userLevel={level}&attemptCount={count}
  ```

- Includes a WebSocket endpoint for real-time prompt performance metrics.
- Offers an admin interface for prompt editing and A/B test configuration.
- Uses a version control system (similar to Git) to track changes, allow rollbacks, and monitor prompt performance over time.

**Prompt Versioning and A/B Testing:**

- All prompts are version-controlled.
- An A/B testing framework allows for the systematic evaluation of different prompt variations. A small percentage of users are randomly assigned to different prompt versions, and key metrics (e.g., task completion rate, feedback rating) are tracked to determine which prompt performs best.

**Contextual Enhancement:**

- Before sending a prompt to an AI model, the system dynamically enhances it with:
  - User skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
  - Learning path progress.
  - Previous submission history and feedback.
  - Common error patterns and best practices for the task and language.

#### 5.1.3 Feedback Generation Process

The feedback generation process follows these steps:

1. **Submission Preprocessing:**

- Normalize user's code (consistent formatting, whitespace removal).
  - **Security:** Scan for malicious patterns (see Section 5.2.8). This is _critical_ to prevent prompt injection attacks.
  - Language detection (if not explicitly specified).

2. **Context Assembly:**

- Retrieve the appropriate prompt template (based on task ID).
  - Populate the template with:
    - Preprocessed code.
    - Task details (description, requirements).
    - User information (skill level, learning path).
    - Previous feedback (if any).

3.**Model Selection:**

- The AI Model Orchestration Layer (see Section 5.1.8) selects the best AI model.

4. **Prompt Execution:**

- The assembled prompt is sent to the selected AI model via its API.
- **Security:** The request uses API keys and appropriate authentication. Requests are made over HTTPS.

5. **Response Post-processing:**

- Parse and validate the AI-generated feedback.
- **Security:** Sanitize the feedback to remove sensitive information or harmful content.
- Format for presentation:
  - Syntax highlighting of code snippets.
  - Visual cues (icons, colors) for issue severity.
  - Collapsible sections for detailed explanations.

6. **Feedback Delivery:** Deliver processed feedback to the user (web or mobile).

7. **Caching (if applicable):** Cache the feedback if it meets the caching criteria (see Section 5.1.9).

8. **Asynchronous Processing:** For long or complex code, use asynchronous processing to avoid timeouts and provide progress updates to the user.

#### 5.1.4 Frontend Layer

- **User Interface**: React.js (v18.3) with TypeScript for the web application. **React Native is used for the native iOS and Android applications, enabling significant code reuse between web and mobile.**
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for global state management in the web application. TanStack Query v5 (formerly React Query) for API data caching and management. **For the mobile app, consider using a similar state management solution that works well with React Native (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or MobX).**
- **UI Components**: Custom component library built on Material UI v5.2 for the web application. **Components are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.  The mobile app will use a combination of shared components (via React Native) and platform-specific components where necessary for optimal user experience.**
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering with Next.js 14+ for the web application (improved initial load time and SEO). **Code splitting, lazy loading, and image optimization are used to enhance performance, especially on mobile.**
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel for user behavior tracking and Google Analytics 4 for website traffic metrics.

#### 5.1.5 Backend Services

The backend is built using a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific domain:

- **API Gateway**: Express.js (running on Node.js v20 LTS) acts as the entry point for all API requests. It handles:
  - **Routing:** Directing requests to the appropriate backend service.
  - **Authentication and Authorization:** Verifying user credentials and permissions (see Section 5.2.1).
  - **Rate Limiting:** Preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource usage (see Section 5.2.3).
  - **Request/Response Transformation:** Adapting requests and responses to different formats as needed.
- **Authentication Service**: Implements OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and JWT for secure authentication. Supports:
  - User registration and login.
  - Social login (Google, GitHub, Microsoft).
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Password reset.
  - **Integration with LMS systems via LTI 1.3 (see Section 5.7).**
  - **Single Sign-On (SSO) support (see Section 5.7.4).**
- **Task Service**: Manages the task library, user submissions, and test case execution.  Responsibilities include:
  - Storing and retrieving task definitions.
  - Managing user submissions and their associated code.
  - Executing test cases against user submissions.
  - Tracking task completion status and progress.
- **Feedback Service**: Orchestrates the AI feedback generation process, including:
  - Interacting with the AI Model Orchestration Layer to select the appropriate AI model.
  - Interacting with the Prompt Management Service to retrieve and populate prompt templates.
  - Managing the Feedback Processing Pipeline (preprocessing, AI model execution, post-processing).
  - Interacting with the Feedback Caching System.
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles, progress tracking, learning paths, and permissions.
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and analyzes user behavior data, feedback quality metrics, and system performance data.  Provides data for reporting, dashboards, and the recommendation system.
- **Payment Service**: Handles subscription management and payment processing via Stripe.
- **Content Service**: Manages the creation, editing, validation, and versioning of learning tasks (see Section 4.11). This service is crucial for maintaining the quality and relevance of the platform's content.

#### 5.1.6 AI/Machine Learning Layer

- **Feedback Engine**: The core of the AI feedback system.  Utilizes a **tiered processing architecture (see Section 5.1.8)** to balance cost, performance, and feedback quality.  Employs the following models:
  - **OpenAI Models:** GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo.
  - **Anthropic Models:** Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3 Sonnet.
    - **Open-Source Models:** Fine-tuned versions of Llama 3 8B (and potentially other open-source LLMs) for specific tasks and as a cost-effective fallback.
    - **(Future) Custom Models:** Specialized models fine-tuned on KodeLab's proprietary dataset of code submissions and feedback.

- **Code Analysis**: Integrates static analysis tools (e.g., Pylint, ESLint, SonarQube) to:
  - Provide preliminary code analysis before sending code to the LLMs.
  - Augment the LLM prompts with information about code style, potential errors, and security vulnerabilities.
  - Validate and refine the feedback generated by the LLMs.

- **Recommendation System**: Uses a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations to suggest relevant tasks to users based on:
  - Their current skill level.
  - Their chosen learning path.
  - Their past performance on similar tasks.
  - The popularity and effectiveness of tasks among other users.

- **Performance Metrics**: Employs machine learning models to evaluate user code efficiency and quality, providing objective metrics to:
  - Inform the feedback generation process.
  - Track user progress and skill development.
  - Calibrate task difficulty.

#### 5.1.7 Data Layer

- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 15 is used for storing structured data, including:
  - User accounts and profiles.
  - Task definitions and metadata.
  - Learning path information.
  - Subscription data.
  - Institutional partnerships and configurations.

- **Document Store**: MongoDB is used for storing flexible schema data, such as:
  - User code submissions.
  - AI-generated feedback (which may have varying structures).
  - Task content (descriptions, instructions, test cases).

- **Cache**: Redis is used for:
  - Session management.
  - Frequently accessed data (e.g., task details, user profiles).
  - **Feedback caching (see Section 5.1.9).**

- **Search**: Elasticsearch is used to provide full-text search capabilities for tasks, documentation, and community content.

- **Vector Database**: Qdrant is used for the storing code embeddings for doing similarity search.

- **Analytics Storage**: TimescaleDB (a time-series database built on PostgreSQL) is used to store:
  - User activity data (e.g., task attempts, code submissions, feedback interactions).
  - System performance metrics (e.g., response times, error rates, resource utilization).
  - AI feedback metrics (e.g., cost per feedback, feedback quality ratings).
  - This data is used for reporting, trend analysis, and continuous improvement of the platform.

#### 5.1.8 Tiered Processing Architecture

This subsection details the multi-tiered AI model selection strategy.

##### 5.1.8.1 Model Hierarchy

A three-tiered hierarchy of AI models balances cost, performance, and capabilities:

| Tier                  | Models                                      | Usage                                                                                                                                                              | Est. Cost/1K tokens | Capabilities                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1 (Lightweight)** | Fine-tuned GPT-3.5,  Custom models (potentially Llama 3 8B finetuned) | Initial screening of all submissions, simple feedback generation, pattern recognition, basic code analysis, handling of common errors.                             | $0.0005-$0.001       | Basic correctness checks, syntax error detection, common code smell identification, formatting issues. Provides quick, inexpensive initial feedback.                          |
| **Tier 2 (Standard)**  | Base GPT-4, Claude Sonnet                   | Most feedback requests, complex syntax analysis, common design pattern identification, style suggestions, basic security checks.                               | $0.01-$0.03       | Detailed feedback on correctness, efficiency, and code quality.  Can handle more complex logic and provide more nuanced explanations.                                   |
| **Tier 3 (Advanced)**  | GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Opus                   | Complex problem-solving tasks, novel solutions, system design challenges, advanced tasks requiring deep reasoning or specialized knowledge, premium user requests. | $0.05-$0.12       | System design feedback, algorithm analysis, advanced security auditing, complex code refactoring suggestions, in-depth explanations, and handling of edge cases. |

##### 5.1.8.2 Request Routing Logic

The `determine_model_tier` function routes feedback requests to the appropriate tier:

```python
def determine_model_tier(user_submission, task_complexity):
    """
    Routes feedback requests to the appropriate model tier based on:
      - User's subscription level (Free, Premium, Pro)
      - Task complexity (determined by task metadata and pre-processing)
      - User's previous submission attempts for the task
      - Current system load (to manage costs and ensure responsiveness)
    """
    complexity_score = analyze_submission_complexity(user_submission)
    user_tier = get_user_subscription_tier(user_id)
    submission_attempt = get_submission_attempt_number(user_id, task_id)

    if submission_attempt == 1 or complexity_score < 3:
        return "tier1"  # Lightweight model for first attempts and simple tasks
    elif complexity_score < 7 or task_complexity == "intermediate":
        return "tier2"  # Standard model for most tasks
    elif user_tier == "premium" or task_complexity == "advanced":
        return "tier3"  # Advanced model for premium users or complex tasks
    else:
        return "tier2"  # Default to standard tier

# Placeholder functions (to be implemented)
def analyze_submission_complexity(submission):
  """Analyzes code submission complexity.

  Factors considered:
    - Code length (lines of code)
    - Cyclomatic complexity
    - Number of function calls
    - Use of advanced language features
    - Presence of concurrency or parallelism
    - Task type (from task metadata)

  Returns:
      int: A complexity score (e.g., 1-10).
  """
  # TODO: Implement complexity analysis.  This is a placeholder.
  # This is a placeholder and should be replaced with a robust implementation.
  # Consider using static analysis tools and heuristics.
  score = len(submission) // 100  # Very basic example - lines of code
  return min(max(1, score), 10) # Clamp to 1-10

def get_user_subscription_tier(user_id):
    """Gets the user's subscription tier."""
    # TODO: Implement database lookup to get user's subscription tier.
    # This is a placeholder.  Replace with actual database query.
    return "free"

def get_submission_attempt_number(user_id, task_id):
   """Gets the number of attempts the user made on a task."""
   # TODO: Implement database query
   return 1
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- **`analyze_submission_complexity(submission)`:** This function is _critical_. It needs to analyze the code and assign a complexity score. Consider using:
  - **Static Analysis:** Use tools like `pylint`, `eslint`, or language-specific parsers to analyze structure, identify complex patterns, and count lines of code.
  - **Heuristics:** Use rules based on keywords, data structures, or algorithms.
  - **Machine Learning:** (Future) Train a model to predict complexity.
- **`get_user_subscription_tier(user_id)`:** Retrieves the user's subscription tier from the database.
- **`get_submission_attempt_number(user_id, task_id)`:** Retrieves the number of attempts the user has made on the task.
  - The function returns tier name.

##### 5.1.8.3 Progressive Deployment

The tiered architecture will be deployed in phases:

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Implement the routing infrastructure, but initially route _all_ traffic to Tier 2.
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-4):** Route a portion (e.g., 30%) of applicable traffic to Tier 1. Monitor feedback quality and user satisfaction.
- **Phase 3 (Months 5-6):** Optimize routing rules. Introduce Tier 3 for premium users and complex tasks.
- **Phase 4 (Month 7+):** Continuously monitor and optimize the system.

#### 5.1.9 Feedback Caching System

This subsection details the feedback caching mechanism, which uses a combination of Redis and Qdrant.

##### 5.1.9.1 Similarity Detection Framework

```python
def get_cached_feedback(submission_code, task_id):
    """
    Checks if a similar submission has already received feedback.
    Returns adapted cached feedback if found, otherwise returns None.
    """
    current_embedding = generate_code_embedding(submission_code)

    # Use Qdrant for similarity search
    potential_matches = qdrant_client.search(
        collection_name="submission_embeddings",
        query_vector=current_embedding,
        query_filter=models.Filter(
            must=[
                models.FieldCondition(key="task_id", match=models.MatchValue(value=task_id))
            ]
        ),
        limit=5,  # Retrieve top 5 similar submissions
        with_payload=True # Get the full payload (including feedback)
    )

    for match in potential_matches:
        if calculate_similarity(current_embedding, match.vector) > 0.92:  # TODO: Tune threshold
            cached_feedback = match.payload['feedback']
            return adapt_cached_feedback(cached_feedback, submission_code)

    return None

def generate_code_embedding(code):
    """Generates a vector embedding for the given code.

    Uses a pre-trained model (e.g., sentence-transformers, CodeBERT) to
    create a numerical representation of the code.
    """
    # TODO: Replace with your chosen embedding model and implementation.
    # This is a CRITICAL component.  Good embeddings are essential for
    # accurate similarity detection.
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2') # Example - choose a good model!
    return model.encode(code).tolist()

def calculate_similarity(embedding1, embedding2):
    """Calculates the cosine similarity between two embeddings."""
    # TODO: You might use a library like SciPy for this.
    # Example (using SciPy):
    from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine
    return 1 - cosine(embedding1, embedding2)
```

**Key Components:**

- **`generate_code_embedding(code)`:** This function uses a pre-trained model (e.g., Sentence-Transformers, CodeBERT) to generate a numerical vector representation (embedding) of the code. **This is a critical component. Choose a model appropriate for code and consider fine-tuning it on your own data.**
- **`qdrant_client.search(...)`:** This performs the similarity search in the Qdrant vector database. You'll need to have Qdrant set up and populated with embeddings of previous submissions.
- **`calculate_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)`:** This function calculates the cosine similarity between two embeddings. You can use libraries like SciPy or NumPy for this.
- **Threshold (0.92):** This is a crucial parameter. You'll need to experiment to find the optimal value.

##### 5.1.9.2 Cache Invalidation Strategy

- **Time-Based:** Cache entries expire after 30 days.
- **Content-Based:** Invalidate caches when task requirements or test cases are updated.
- **Model-Based:** Refresh caches when AI models are upgraded/fine-tuned.

##### 5.1.9.3 Adaptation Layer

```python
def adapt_cached_feedback(cached_feedback, current_code):
    """
    Personalizes cached feedback for the current submission:
      - Replaces variable names and other specific identifiers.
      - Adjusts line numbers in error messages (if applicable).

    personalized_feedback += "\n\n_This feedback has been adapted from similar submissions while maintaining accuracy._"
    return personalized_feedback

# Placeholder functions (to be implemented)
def extract_code_elements(code):
    """Extracts variable names, function names, etc. from code (TODO: Implement).

    This will require language-specific parsing (e.g., using the `ast`
    module for Python, `esprima` for JavaScript).  A robust implementation

    """
    # TODO: Implement using a language-specific parser (e.g., ast for Python).

    """Replaces placeholders in the feedback with actual code elements."""
    # TODO: Implement a robust replacement mechanism.  This could involve:
    #   - Simple string replacement (for basic cases).
    #   - Regular expressions.
    #   - A templating engine.
    #   - AST-based manipulation (for the most accurate results).
     for key, value in elements.items():
        feedback = feedback.replace(key, value)

**TODO:**

- **`extract_code_elements(code)`:** Implement this using a language-specific parser. This is crucial for accurate adaptation.
- **`replace_code_references(feedback, elements)`:** Implement a robust replacement mechanism.

#### 5.1.10 Real-time Cost/Performance Dashboard

A real-time dashboard monitors the AI feedback system's performance and cost.

##### 5.1.10.1 Metrics Tracking

| Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Update Frequency | Data Source |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **Cost**        | Cost per token, cost per feedback request, daily total cost, weekly cost trend | Real-time | AI provider APIs, internal billing data |
| **Performance** | Average response time, feedback quality rating (user-provided), user satisfaction (survey data) | Hourly | Database (user ratings), Application logs |
| **Usage**       | Requests per model, token usage distribution, cache hit rate | Real-time | Application logs, Redis/Qdrant metrics |
| **Quality**     | User feedback ratings, feedback implementation rate, task completion rate | Daily | Database (user actions, task progress) |

##### 5.1.10.2 Alert System

Automated alerts are triggered by:

- **Cost Spikes:** Exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., 30% above daily average).
- **Quality Drops:** Sustained drop in feedback quality ratings (e.g., below 4.2/5).
- **Low Cache Hit Rate:** Cache hit rate falling below an expected threshold.
- **Model Availability/Performance:** Issues with AI model availability or performance.
- **Anomalies**: Any unusual or unexpected behaviors in the metrics.

##### 5.1.10.3 Dashboard Design

The dashboard provides:

- **Executive Summary:** Key metrics at a glance (cost, quality, performance).
- **Cost Breakdown:** Cost analysis by model tier, task category, and individual task.
- **Quality Metrics:** Feedback quality ratings and user satisfaction scores, broken down by model and task type.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualizations of key metrics over time (daily, weekly, monthly), with trend lines and projections.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Suggestions for optimizing cost and performance (e.g., adjusting routing rules, fine-tuning models, updating prompts).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Automatic identification of unusual patterns or outliers in the metrics.
- **Root Cause Analysis Tools:** Tools to help diagnose the root cause of performance issues or cost spikes (e.g., log viewers, query analyzers).

**Implementation Notes:**

- Use a dashboarding tool like Grafana or a custom-built dashboard.
- Integrate with Prometheus for metrics collection.
- Use the ELK stack for log analysis.

#### 5.1.11 Model Rotation Strategy

This subsection describes the dynamic model selection and management.

##### 5.1.11.1 Performance/Cost Ratio Monitoring

A continuous efficiency score is calculated for each AI model:

```python
def calculate_model_efficiency(model_id, time_period="24h"):
    """
    Calculates an efficiency score for a given AI model based on:
      - Average feedback quality rating

    return 0.05

def get_avg_response_time(model_id, time_period):
    """Retrieves the average response time for a model."""
    # TODO: Implement database query to retrieve average response time.
    # This is a placeholder. Replace with actual database query.
    return 2.5

max_acceptable_cost = 0.10  # Example value - adjust as needed
max_acceptable_time = 5.0  # Example value - adjust as needed
```

##### 5.1.11.2 Automatic Failover

The system implements automatic model rotation and failover based on these criteria:

- **Availability:** If a model becomes unavailable (e.g., API outage, service disruption), requests are immediately and automatically routed to a fallback model. The system continuously monitors the health and availability of all configured AI models.

- **Response Time:** If a model's average response time exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 5 seconds), requests are temporarily routed to a faster model. This ensures a responsive user experience even if a preferred model is experiencing performance issues.
- **Cost Fluctuations:** If a model's price increases significantly (e.g., due to surge pricing or changes in provider pricing), the system automatically re-evaluates the cost-effectiveness of using that model and may route requests to a more economical option, provided it still meets the minimum quality requirements.
- **Quality Degradation:** The system will switch the model, if the quality of the feedback is degrading.

##### 5.1.11.3 A/B Testing Framework

To continuously evaluate and improve model performance, an A/B testing framework is implemented:

- **Candidate Models:** New models, updated versions of existing models, or models with different configurations are designated as "candidate" models.
- **Traffic Allocation:** A small percentage of feedback requests (e.g., 5%) are routed to candidate models. This allows for real-world performance evaluation without significantly impacting the overall user experience.
- **Performance Evaluation:** The performance of candidate models is evaluated based on the same metrics used for the efficiency score (quality, cost, speed).
- **Automated Promotion:** If a candidate model consistently outperforms the current production model(s) based on predefined criteria, it is automatically promoted to handle a larger share of traffic.
- **Automated Reporting:** The system automatically generates reports on A/B test results, including statistical significance and confidence intervals, to inform model selection decisions.

#### 5.1.12 AI Feedback Quality Assurance

To ensure consistent and high-quality AI feedback, KodeLab employs a multi-faceted quality assurance process:

- **Quality Metrics:** A comprehensive set of metrics tracks feedback quality. (See section 5.1.10)
- **Human Review Loop:**
  - An **Instructor Review Dashboard** displays samples of AI-generated feedback.
  - Instructors can flag problematic feedback and provide corrected examples.
  - A **Quality Improvement Cycle:**
    1. Regular sampling of feedback (weighted toward new tasks and low-performing models).
    2. Expert review against an educational rubric.
    3. Identification of patterns for systematic improvement.
    4. Updates to prompt engineering and the pattern library.
    5. A/B testing of feedback improvements.

- **Pattern Library:** A structured library of common code patterns and associated feedback:
  - Organized by language, challenge type, conceptual errors, and optimization opportunities.
  - Each pattern includes:
    - Code pattern template (with variables).
    - Associated educational concepts.
    - Recommended feedback templates.
    - Historical effectiveness score.
  - Continuously expanded through automated pattern identification and instructor contributions.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:**
  - The system tracks the user's implementation rate for feedback.
  - All the metrics tracked will be used to improve AI performance.

### 5.5 AI Feedback System (Detailed Components)

This section provides further detail on specific components and functionalities within the AI Feedback System.

#### 5.5.1 Prompt Engineering Architecture

The prompt engineering architecture is designed for flexibility, maintainability, and continuous improvement. Key aspects include:

- **Multi-tiered Prompt System:** A hierarchical prompting system allows for increasingly specific and nuanced feedback:
  - **Core Task Context Prompts:** These provide the fundamental information about the task, including the description, requirements, constraints, and any relevant background information.  These prompts are relatively static and change only when the task itself is updated.
  - **Code Evaluation Prompts:** These prompts focus on specific aspects of the code, such as correctness, efficiency, style, and security.  They are designed to be modular and reusable across different tasks.  Examples include:
    - `"Analyze the following Python code for potential performance bottlenecks. Focus on algorithmic complexity and database interactions."`
    - `"Identify any potential security vulnerabilities in the following JavaScript code, considering common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection."`
    - `"Evaluate the following Java code for adherence to coding best practices and style guidelines."`
  - **Feedback Synthesis Prompts:** These prompts take the output from the code evaluation prompts and synthesize it into a coherent, user-friendly, and personalized feedback message. They incorporate user context (skill level, learning path, previous feedback) to tailor the tone, depth, and focus of the feedback.

- **Contextual Enhancement:** Prompts are dynamically enhanced with contextual information:
  - **User Skill Level and Learning History:** The system tracks the user's progress and performance on previous tasks, adjusting the feedback accordingly (e.g., providing more detailed explanations for beginners, focusing on advanced concepts for experienced users).
  - **Previous Submission Patterns and Feedback Responses:** The system analyzes the user's previous submissions for the current task, identifying recurring errors or areas for improvement.  The feedback focuses on addressing these persistent issues.
  - **Industry Best Practices:** Prompts incorporate knowledge of industry best practices and coding standards specific to the task category and programming language. This knowledge is maintained in a separate knowledge base and dynamically injected into the prompts.

- **Prompt Versioning:** A systematic A/B testing framework supports continuous prompt improvement:
  - **Automated Performance Tracking:** Key metrics (e.g., user feedback ratings, task completion rates, code improvement metrics) are tracked for each prompt version.
  - **Controlled Rollout:** New prompt templates are initially rolled out to a small percentage of users (e.g., 5%) to assess their performance in a real-world setting.
  - **Historical Versioning:** All prompt versions are stored, allowing for comparison of performance over time and rollback to previous versions if necessary.
  - **Prompt API Endpoints**: The Prompt Management provides API endpoints to perform prompt management operations:
    - **Create Prompt:**

      ```
         POST /api/v1/prompts
         Content-Type: application/json
          {
             "task_id": "unique-task-identifier",
             "prompt_type": "code_evaluation", // e.g., "task_context", "code_evaluation", "feedback_synthesis"
             "language": "python",
             "version": "1.0",
             "template": "Analyze the following Python code for potential performance bottlenecks...",
             "parameters": {
            "code_snippet": "string",
               "user_level": "string"
             },
           "metadata": {
             "average_tokens": 300,
              "models": ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "claude-3-sonnet"]
             }
         }
         ```

    - **Update Prompt:**

       ```
           PUT /api/v1/prompts/{prompt_id}
           Content-Type: application/json
            {
              "version": "1.1",
              "template": "Updated prompt template...",
              "parameters": {
               "code_snippet": "string",
               "user_level": "string",
                "error_messages": "string[]"
             }
            }
          ```

    - **Get Prompt:**

       ```
           GET /api/v1/prompts/{prompt_id}
        ```

    - **Delete Prompt:**

       ```
          DELETE /api/v1/prompts/{prompt_id}
          ```

    - **List Prompts:**

       ```
           GET /api/v1/prompts?task_id=unique-task-identifier&language=python
           ```
    - **Test Prompt:**

       ```
          POST /api/v1/prompts/{prompt_id}/test
            Content-Type: application/json
          {
          "input_parameters": {
          "code_snippet": "def my_function(x):\n return x * 2",
           "user_level": "beginner"
             }
          }
         ```

    - **Prompt Performance:**

       ```
          GET /api/v1/prompts/{prompt_id}/performance?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31
        ```

#### 5.5.2 Feedback Evaluation System

The Feedback Evaluation System continuously monitors and improves the quality of AI-generated feedback.

- **Quality Monitoring:** Continuous evaluation of AI feedback quality using multiple methods:
  - **Automated Scoring:**  Feedback is automatically scored based on predefined rubrics, assessing:
    - **Specificity:**  Does the feedback provide concrete examples and pinpoint specific areas for improvement?
    - **Actionability:**  Does the feedback offer clear, actionable steps that the user can take?
    - **Tone:**  Is the feedback encouraging, constructive, and appropriate for the user's skill level?
    - **Correctness**: Does the feedback technically correct?
    - **Relevance**: Does the feedback is relevant to the code?
    - **Comprehensiveness**: Is the feedback covers all the aspects of the code?
  - **Expert Human Review:** A random sample of feedback (e.g., 10% of all feedback) is reviewed by expert software engineers and educators.  Reviewers evaluate the feedback against the same rubric used for automated scoring and provide additional qualitative feedback.
  - **User Satisfaction Ratings:**  Users are prompted to rate the helpfulness of the feedback they receive (e.g., on a 1-5 star scale).  They can also provide optional text feedback.
  - **User Implementation Rate**: Measures if the user has implemented the feedback or not.

- **Calibration Mechanism:**  A regular recalibration process (e.g., monthly) ensures that the feedback system remains effective over time:
  - **Model Fine-tuning:**  The AI models are fine-tuned using newly validated examples of high-quality feedback and identified areas for improvement.
  - **Parameter Optimization:**  The parameters of the feedback generation process (e.g., temperature, top_p) are adjusted to optimize for consistency and quality across different task types and languages.
  - **Bias Detection and Mitigation:**  The system is regularly evaluated for potential biases (e.g., gender bias, language bias) and mitigation strategies are implemented.

- **Performance Metrics Dashboard:**  A real-time dashboard monitors key performance indicators:
  - **Feedback Latency:**  The time it takes to generate feedback.
  - **Feedback Reliability:**  The percentage of feedback requests that are successfully completed.
  - **User Implementation of Suggested Improvements:**  Tracking how often users incorporate the feedback they receive into their code.  This is a key indicator of feedback effectiveness.
  - **Correlation between Feedback Quality and User Progress:**  Analyzing the relationship between feedback quality metrics and user performance on subsequent tasks.

#### 5.5.3 Fallback and Redundancy Systems

To ensure high availability and resilience, the AI feedback system incorporates multiple layers of redundancy and fallback mechanisms:

- **Model Redundancy:**  A multi-model architecture provides resilience against individual model failures:
  - **Primary Tier:** GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus are used for comprehensive feedback generation.
  - **Secondary Tier:** GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude Sonnet provide backup capacity and handle less complex requests.
  - **Tertiary Tier:** Fine-tuned lightweight models (e.g., Llama 3 8B or smaller, specialized models) are used for basic feedback generation and as a final fallback.
  - **(Future) Custom Models**

- **Pricing Contingency:**  An adaptive system manages API cost fluctuations:
  - **Dynamic Request Routing:**  Requests are dynamically routed to different AI providers and models based on cost-performance optimization.
  - **Caching:**  Common feedback patterns are cached to reduce the number of API calls (see Section 5.1.9).
  - **Gradual Degradation:**  In cases of extreme cost increases or API limitations, the system may temporarily reduce the level of detail or personalization in the feedback, while still providing core functionality.

- **Availability Strategy:**  A high-availability design ensures continuous operation:
  - **Geographic Distribution:**  API endpoints and processing infrastructure are distributed across multiple geographic regions to mitigate the impact of regional outages.
  - **Asynchronous Feedback Delivery:**  Feedback generation is handled asynchronously, allowing the system to queue requests and process them when resources are available.  Users are notified when feedback is ready.
  - **Pre-computed Feedback Templates:**  For common errors and code patterns, pre-computed feedback templates are available as a fallback if the AI models are unavailable.
  - **Human-in-the-Loop Fallback:**  For premium users or in critical situations, a human review process can be triggered if automated feedback generation fails.

#### 5.5.4 Continuous Improvement Pipeline

A closed-loop feedback system drives continuous improvement:

- **Feedback Collection Framework:**  Systematic gathering of:
  - **Direct User Ratings:**  Users rate feedback quality (helpful/not helpful).
  - **Task Completion Rates:**  Tracking task completion rates after feedback.
  - **Time-to-Solution Metrics:**  Measuring time to solution before and after feedback.
- **Learning Loop:**
  - **Weekly Analysis:**  Analysis of low-performing feedback patterns.
  - **Prompt Refinement:**  Prompts are refined based on performance data.
  - **A/B Testing:**  Alternative feedback approaches are tested.
- **Knowledge Repository:**  Expanding database of:
  - Effective feedback examples.
  - Common misconception/solution pairs.
  - Task-specific expert insights.

This completes the detailed description of the AI Feedback System. Remember to replace the placeholder comments and TODOs with your actual implementation details.

#### 5.7.4 Technical Implementation

- **API Endpoints:**  The following RESTful API endpoints are used for LMS communication:
  - `/api/v1/lms/auth`: Handles authentication and session management for LMS integrations.  This includes handling LTI launch requests, OAuth 2.0 flows, and API key authentication.
  - `/api/v1/lms/courses`: Provides endpoints for mapping KodeLab courses to LMS courses, retrieving LMS course structures, and synchronizing course information.
  - `/api/v1/lms/assignments`: Manages assignment creation, syncing, and linking between KodeLab and LMS platforms.  This includes creating assignments in the LMS, associating them with KodeLab tasks, and handling submission events.
  - `/api/v1/lms/grades`: Handles grade passback from KodeLab to LMS gradebooks. This uses the LTI Assignment and Grade Services (AGS) when available, and platform-specific APIs otherwise.
  - `/api/v1/lms/users`: Provides endpoints for user provisioning, deprovisioning, role management, and roster synchronization.
  - `/api/v1/lms/lti/launch`:  A dedicated endpoint for handling LTI launch requests, complying with the LTI 1.3 standard.
  - `/api/v1/lms/jwks`: Provides the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint for LTI 1.3, used for verifying the digital signatures of LTI messages.

- **Data Synchronization:**
  - **Real-time Webhooks:** Webhook notifications are used for critical events (e.g., new submissions, grade updates) to ensure immediate synchronization between KodeLab and the LMS.
  - **Configurable Periodic Syncing:** Scheduled synchronization tasks (configurable from 15 minutes to 24 hours) handle less time-sensitive data (e.g., roster updates, course information).  The frequency can be adjusted based on institutional needs and LMS API limits.
  - **Conflict Resolution:** Strategies are in place to handle potential conflicts arising from concurrent updates in KodeLab and the LMS.  This might involve prioritizing one system as the source of truth or using timestamps to determine the most recent update.
  - **Batch Processing:** For large-scale data transfers (e.g., initial course setup, end-of-term grade synchronization), batch processing is used to improve efficiency and avoid API rate limits.

- **Error Handling:**
  - **Comprehensive Logging:** All integration activities, including successes, failures, and errors, are logged with detailed context.
  - **Automatic Retry:** Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff are implemented for temporary network or API issues.
  - **Admin Alerts:** Alerts are sent to administrators for persistent synchronization failures or critical errors that require manual intervention.
  - **Self-Healing:** Where possible, the system attempts to automatically resolve common integration problems (e.g., re-establishing connections, re-authenticating).

#### 5.7.5 Institutional Integration Features

- **Roster Synchronization:** Automatic student enrollment and unenrollment in KodeLab courses based on LMS course rosters. This ensures that student lists in KodeLab are always up-to-date with the LMS.
- **Custom Branding:** Institutions can customize the KodeLab platform with their logo, color scheme, and a custom subdomain (e.g., `universityname.kodelab.com`).
- **Curriculum Alignment:** Tools and features are provided to help instructors map KodeLab tasks to specific learning objectives, outcomes, and curriculum standards. This facilitates the integration of KodeLab into existing courses.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Institution-specific dashboards provide insights into student performance, engagement, and skill development, aggregated at the course, department, or institution level.
- **Departmental Administration:** Role-based access control allows department heads, instructors, and teaching assistants to manage users, courses, and assignments within their respective departments.
- **Custom Task Creation:** Faculty can create institution-specific coding challenges and integrate them into the platform, supplementing the existing task library.
- **Academic Integrity:** Plagiarism detection and code similarity analysis are available for submitted solutions to help maintain academic integrity.
- **Batch Enrollment:** Bulk user provisioning is supported through CSV upload or API integration, simplifying the onboarding of large numbers of students.

#### 5.7.6 LMS-Specific Implementation Details

(This section consolidates and expands upon the previous LMS-specific examples.)

##### Canvas Integration

**Implementation Status**: Complete

**Integration Method**: LTI 1.3 + Canvas API

```javascript
// Canvas-specific LTI implementation (Illustrative Example)
class CanvasLtiAdapter extends BaseLtiAdapter {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config);
    this.canvasApi = new CanvasApiClient(config.apiToken); // TODO: Implement Canvas API client
  }

  async handleLaunch(request) {
    const launchData = await super.handleLaunch(request);

    // Canvas-specific parameter handling
    if (launchData.custom_canvas_course_id) {
      launchData.courseId = launchData.custom_canvas_course_id;

      // Fetch additional course context (example)
      try {
        const courseDetails = await this.canvasApi.getCourse(launchData.courseId);
        launchData.courseContext = courseDetails;
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn('Failed to fetch Canvas course details:', error);
      }
    }

    return launchData;
  }

    async syncGrades(submission) {
      if (!submission.ltiContext ||
          !submission.ltiContext.lis_outcome_service_url ||
          !submission.ltiContext.lis_result_sourcedid) {
          throw new Error('Missing LTI context for grade sync.');
      }

      const normalizedScore = submission.score / submission.maxScore;

      return this.sendOutcome(
        submission.ltiContext.lis_outcome_service_url,
        submission.ltiContext.lis_result_sourcedid,
        normalizedScore
      );
    }

    async getAssignmentConfiguration(courseId, assignmentId) {
        // Get Canvas-specific assignment settings using the Canvas API.
        const settings = await this.canvasApi.getAssignmentSettings(courseId, assignmentId);

        return {
          pointsPossible: settings.points_possible,
          dueDate: settings.due_at,
          unlockDate: settings.unlock_at,

While the web app will be our initial mobile offering, we're strategically designing it to facilitate a seamless transition to native apps in the future. These are our key considerations:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**

    - **Reusable Components:** Designing the web app using a component-based architecture (e.g., React) to maximize code reusability when building native apps with React Native.
    - **UI Consistency:** Ensuring UI components and styles are consistent between web and native, minimizing the need for redesign.

2. **Data Layer Abstraction:**

    - **API-Driven:** Relying on a robust API for all data interactions, which can be used by both the web app and native apps.
    - **Data Model Alignment:** Ensuring that data models in the web app are compatible with the data models in the native apps.

3. **Business Logic Separation:**

    - **Core Logic in Shared Code:** Encapsulating core business logic (e.g., task submission, feedback processing) in code that can be shared between the web app and native apps.
    - **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** Localizing platform-specific adaptations (UI interactions, device features) within the web app and native apps separately.

4. **Offline-First Mentality:**

    - **Local Data Storage:** Implementing robust local data storage in the web app (using IndexedDB or similar) to facilitate offline use and ease the transition to native offline functionality.
    - **Sync Strategies:** Defining clear strategies for syncing data between the client and server.

5. **Accessibility**:

    - Using WCAG standard for accessibility and making sure that all features work seamlessly.

6. **Consistent UX Patterns:**

    - **Navigation:** Adopting consistent navigation patterns in the web app that can be easily translated to native app navigation.
    - **Interaction Design:** Using touch-friendly interactions that are adaptable to both web and native.

7. **Modular Architecture:**
    - **Feature Modules:** Structuring the code into distinct feature modules that can be easily adapted or reused in native apps.
    - **Clear Interfaces:** Defining clear interfaces between modules to reduce dependencies and simplify code reuse.

By making these design decisions now, we can ensure a more efficient development process when we transition to native apps, while providing a consistent user experience across all platforms.

#### Task 25: API Authentication Implementation

**Title**: Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

**Description**: Create a complete OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow implementation for a web application, including client credential management, authorization endpoint, token exchange, and profile access.

**Test Cases**:

- Authorization Request: Input: User clicks "Login with Provider", Expected: Redirect to authorization server with proper parameters, Output: Authorization code returned.
- Token Exchange: Input: Valid authorization code, Expected: POST to token endpoint with code, client credentials, and redirect URI, Output: Valid access token.
- Invalid Grant: Input: Expired/invalid code, Expected: Error handling, Output: User-friendly error message.
- Profile Retrieval: Input: Valid access token, Expected: GET to userinfo endpoint, Output: User profile data.
- Token Refresh: Input: Expired access token with refresh token, Expected: Request new access token, Output: Continued user session.

**Difficulty**: Expert

**Required Knowledge**: OAuth 2.0, API security, JWT handling.

**Ideal Solution**:

```javascript
// Client-side implementation
async function initiateOAuthFlow() {
  // Generate and store PKCE code verifier
  const codeVerifier = generateRandomString(128);
  localStorage.setItem("code_verifier", codeVerifier);

  // Generate code challenge from verifier
  const codeChallenge = await generateCodeChallenge(codeVerifier);

  // Build authorization URL with required parameters
  const authUrl = new URL("https://auth-provider.com/authorize");
  authUrl.searchParams.append("response_type", "code");
  authUrl.searchParams.append("client_id", "YOUR_CLIENT_ID");
  authUrl.searchParams.append("redirect_uri", "https://your-app.com/callback");
  authUrl.searchParams.append("scope", "profile email");
  authUrl.searchParams.append("state", generateRandomString(32));
  authUrl.searchParams.append("code_challenge", codeChallenge);
  authUrl.searchParams.append("code_challenge_method", "S256");

  // Redirect to authorization server
  window.location = authUrl.toString();
}

// Handle the callback with authorization code
async function handleCallback(authCode) {
  try {
    // Exchange code for token
    const tokenResponse = await fetch("https://auth-provider.com/token", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      },
      body: new URLSearchParams({
        grant_type: "authorization_code",
        code: authCode,
        redirect_uri: "https://your-app.com/callback",
        client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        code_verifier: localStorage.getItem("code_verifier"),
      }),
    });

    const tokenData = await tokenResponse.json();

    if (!tokenResponse.ok) {
      throw new Error(
        tokenData.error_description || "Failed to exchange authorization code"
      );
    }

    // Store tokens securely
    saveTokens(
      tokenData.access_token,
      tokenData.refresh_token,
      tokenData.expires_in
    );

    // Get user profile
    const userProfile = await fetchUserProfile(tokenData.access_token);

    // Complete authentication process
    loginUser(userProfile);
  } catch (error) {

  }
}

// Helper to fetch user profile with access token
async function fetchUserProfile(accessToken) {

      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch user profile");
  }

  return response.json();
}

// Implement token refresh functionality
async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://auth-provider.com/token", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      },
      body: new URLSearchParams({
        grant_type: "refresh_token",
        refresh_token: refreshToken,
        client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      }),
    });

    const tokenData = await response.json();

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(tokenData.error_description || "Failed to refresh token");
    }

    // Update stored tokens
    saveTokens(
      tokenData.access_token,
      tokenData.refresh_token || refreshToken,
      tokenData.expires_in
    );

    return tokenData.access_token;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Token refresh failed:", error);
    // Force re-authentication
    initiateOAuthFlow();
    throw error;
  }
}

// Helper for PKCE code challenge generation
async function generateCodeChallenge(verifier) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const data = encoder.encode(verifier);
  const digest = await window.crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", data);

  return base64UrlEncode(digest);
}

// Base64URL encoding helper
function base64UrlEncode(buffer) {
  return btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(buffer)))
    .replace(/\+/g, "-")
    .replace(/\//g, "_")
    .replace(/=+$/, "");
}

// Generate cryptographically secure random string
function generateRandomString(length) {
  const array = new Uint8Array(length);
  window.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
  return Array.from(array, (byte) =>
    ("0" + (byte & 0xff).toString(16)).slice(-2)
  ).join("");
}
```
