## Feedback Fallback Mechanisms

### Degradation Response Tiers
1. **Performance Degradation**: Intelligent request queuing with priority system
2. **Partial Availability**: Fallback to pattern-based feedback with reduced personalization
3. **Service Interruption**: Cached response patterns and scheduled delivery
4. **Extended Outage**: Manual review trigger with notification system

### Pattern-Based Fallback System
- Pre-computed feedback for common error patterns
- Language-specific static analysis when AI is unavailable
- Test case results with generic guidance
- Historical similar submission matching

### Recovery Procedures
- Automated service restoration verification
- Prioritized processing of backlogged submissions
- Student notification when full feedback becomes available
- Post-incident analysis and resilience improvement

## Capacity Planning

### Growth Modeling
- Student user growth projections by institution type
- Feedback request volume based on assignment patterns
- Storage requirements for submission history and analytics
- Machine learning model expansion for pattern recognition

### Resource Allocation Strategy
- Dynamic scaling based on predictive usage patterns
- Reserve capacity for unexpected usage spikes
- Cost-optimized baseline infrastructure
- Geographic distribution for performance optimization

## Business Continuity

### Disaster Recovery
- Complete system recovery capability with defined RPO/RTO
- Regular recovery testing and validation
- Documentation for emergency procedures
- Cross-team training for incident response

### Data Protection
- Comprehensive backup strategy for all student and course data
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Data retention policies aligned with educational requirements
- Privacy-preserving backup encryption

### Communication Plan

- Status page with service health indicators
- Scheduled maintenance announcement protocol

## Technical Design Integration

### Infrastructure Resilience
- **Multi-region Deployment**: Primary and standby infrastructure in geographically separated regions 
- **Resilience-as-Code**: Infrastructure templates with embedded monitoring, auto-recovery, and fallback mechanisms
- **Chaos Engineering Practice**: Regular simulated failures to validate recovery processes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Progressive feature reduction under resource constraints
- **Infrastructure Security**: Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

### Monitoring Integration
- Comprehensive observability pipeline connecting all infrastructure components
- Health check dashboards with component-level status visualization
- Automated correlation between infrastructure metrics and user experience impacts
