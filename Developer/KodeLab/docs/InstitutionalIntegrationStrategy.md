        self.institution_id = institution_id
        self.lms_type = lms_type
        self.checks = [
            self.verify_authentication,
            self.verify_course_sync,
            self.verify_assignment_flow,
            self.verify_grade_passback,
            self.verify_content_embedding,
            self.verify_api_access
        ]
        
    def run_all_checks(self):
        """Run all health checks and produce a comprehensive report"""
        results = {
            "institution_id": self.institution_id,
            "lms_type": self.lms_type,
            "check_time": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "overall_status": "pending",
            "checks": []
        }
        
        for check in self.checks:
            check_result = check()
            results["checks"].append(check_result)
            if check_result["status"] == "error" and results["overall_status"] != "error":
                results["overall_status"] = "warning"
            if check_result["status"] == "critical":
                results["overall_status"] = "error"
        
        if results["overall_status"] == "pending":
            results["overall_status"] = "healthy"
            
        # Store results and trigger alerts if needed
        self._store_check_results(results)
        if results["overall_status"] != "healthy":
            self._trigger_alerts(results)
            
        return results
    
    def verify_authentication(self):
        """Verify SSO and authentication flows are working properly"""
        # Implementation details for authentication testing

    coursesUsingPlatform,
    averageInstructorSalary,
    averageClassSize,
    estimatedGradingTimePerAssignment,
    assignmentsPerTerm,
    currentPassRate,
    expectedPassRateImprovement,
    costPerStudentDropout,
    platformCostPerStudent
  } = inputs;
  
  // Calculate instructor time savings
  const totalAssignments = studentCount * assignmentsPerTerm;
  const currentGradingHours = totalAssignments * estimatedGradingTimePerAssignment;
  const estimatedGradingReduction = 0.65; // 65% reduction in grading time
  const gradingHoursSaved = currentGradingHours * estimatedGradingReduction;
  const instructorCostPerHour = averageInstructorSalary / 2080; // 2080 working hours per year
  const gradingCostSavings = gradingHoursSaved * instructorCostPerHour;
  
  // Calculate student success improvements
  const currentFailingStudents = studentCount * (1 - currentPassRate);
  const improvedFailingStudents = studentCount * (1 - (currentPassRate + expectedPassRateImprovement));
  const studentRetentionImprovement = currentFailingStudents - improvedFailingStudents;
  const retentionSavings = studentRetentionImprovement * costPerStudentDropout;
  
  // Calculate platform costs
  const totalPlatformCost = studentCount * platformCostPerStudent;
  
  // Calculate ROI
  const totalBenefits = gradingCostSavings + retentionSavings;
  const roi = (totalBenefits - totalPlatformCost) / totalPlatformCost;
  const paybackPeriodMonths = (totalPlatformCost / totalBenefits) * 12;
  
  return {
    timeValue: {
      gradingHoursSaved,
      gradingCostSavings
    },
    studentSuccess: {
      studentRetentionImprovement,
      retentionSavings
    },
    costs: {
      totalPlatformCost
    },
    roi: {
      percentage: roi * 100,
      paybackPeriodMonths,
      netValue: totalBenefits - totalPlatformCost
    }
  };
}
```

### 4.3 Comparative Improvement Dashboards

Institutions will receive dashboard access showing their performance metrics compared to anonymized peer institutions:

```jsx
// Dashboard component example
const InstitutionalComparisonDashboard = ({ institutionId }) => {
  const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState(null);
  const [benchmarks, setBenchmarks] = useState(null);
  const [timeframe, setTimeframe] = useState('term'); // term, year, multi-year
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch institution-specific metrics
    async function fetchData() {
      const institutionData = await fetchInstitutionMetrics(institutionId, timeframe);
      const benchmarkData = await fetchPeerBenchmarks(institutionId, timeframe);
      setMetrics(institutionData);
      setBenchmarks(benchmarkData);
    }
    fetchData();
  }, [institutionId, timeframe]);
  
  if (!metrics || !benchmarks) return <LoadingIndicator />;
