# AI Feedback Quality Framework

## Overview
This document outlines KodeLab's comprehensive approach to ensuring high-quality, educationally valuable AI feedback for student code submissions.

## Quality Metrics

### Relevance Score
- **Definition**: Measures how directly the feedback addresses the specific code issues or improvement opportunities
- **Calculation**: Combination of pattern matching confidence and semantic relevance to challenge objectives
- **Target**: Minimum 85% relevance across all feedback instances

### Educational Value Index
- **Definition**: Assesses whether feedback provides learning opportunities beyond just error correction
- **Components**: 
  - Explanation quality (does it teach the "why" behind recommendations?)
  - Reference to programming principles
  - Scalability of concepts to other scenarios
- **Measurement**: Regular sampling and expert review

### User Satisfaction Rating
- **Implementation**: Simple 1-5 star rating system after students review feedback
- **Critical Threshold**: Automated alerts for any feedback receiving consistently low ratings

## Human Review Loop

### Instructor Review Dashboard
- Shows samples of AI-generated feedback for instructor courses
- Enables flagging of problematic feedback patterns
- Provides mechanism to add custom explanations to the pattern library

### Quality Improvement Cycle
1. Regular sampling of feedback (weighted toward new challenge types)
2. Expert review against educational rubric
3. Pattern identification for systematic improvement
4. Updates to prompt engineering and pattern library
5. A/B testing of feedback improvements

## Pattern Library Architecture

### Organization Structure
- Language-specific patterns
- Challenge-type patterns
- Conceptual error patterns
- Code optimization patterns

### Pattern Entry Components
- Code pattern template (with variables)
- Associated educational concepts
- Recommended feedback templates
- Historical effectiveness score

### Continuous Expansion Strategy
- Automated identification of recurring patterns from submissions
- Regular imports from instructor-provided examples
- Integration of patterns from programming education research

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: Core metrics implementation and baseline establishment
- Phase 2: Human review loop deployment with limited instructor group
- Phase 3: Pattern library expansion and automated improvement cycle
- Phase 4: Advanced personalization based on student history and learning style
