# Accessibility and User Experience Guidelines

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
KodeLab commits to meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards across all platform components with particular focus on:

#### Perceivable
- **Text Alternatives**: All non-text content has text alternatives
- **Time-based Media**: Captions and audio descriptions for video tutorials
- **Adaptable Content**: Content presentable in different ways without losing information
- **Distinguishable Elements**: Content easy to see and hear with sufficient contrast

#### Operable
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: All functionality available from keyboard
- **Time Limitations**: Adjustable timing for code submission and review
- **Navigation**: Multiple ways to find content and understand location
- **Input Modalities**: Support for various input methods beyond keyboard/mouse

#### Understandable
- **Readable**: Text content readable and understandable
- **Predictable**: Web pages operate and appear in predictable ways
- **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes in code submission

#### Robust
- **Compatible**: Content compatible with current and future user tools
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with actionable solutions

### Implementation Strategy
- Accessibility audit in each development sprint
- Automated testing with manual verification
- User testing with assistive technologies
- Documented accessibility features for institutional compliance

## Student Onboarding Experience

### First-Time User Journey
1. **Welcome Orientation**: Interactive tour of platform features
2. **Skill Assessment**: Optional lightweight assessment to personalize starting point
3. **Quick Win Challenges**: 2-3 simple challenges designed for immediate success
4. **Feedback Introduction**: Guided experience with AI feedback mechanism
5. **Progress Tracking Orientation**: Introduction to personal dashboard elements

### Scaffolded Learning Approach
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Interface elements introduced as needed
- **Contextual Help**: Just-in-time guidance for specific actions
- **Achievement Milestones**: Early and frequent recognition of progress
- **Peer Examples**: Optional access to anonymized successful solutions

### Retention Strategy
- Regular progress summaries and achievement badges
- Personalized challenge recommendations based on performance
- Reminder system aligned with course schedules

## Mobile Experience Design

### Mobile-First Considerations
- **Code Review Optimization**: Enhanced readability for feedback on mobile devices
- **Responsive Editor**: Touch-friendly simplified editor for minor edits
- **Offline Capability**: Access to previously received feedback without connectivity
- **Notification Integration**: Mobile-friendly alerts for feedback and course updates

### Cross-Device Continuity
