# Educational Skills Taxonomy

## Overview
KodeLab's Skills Taxonomy provides a structured framework for mapping programming challenges to specific technical and problem-solving competencies valued in academic and professional environments.

## Taxonomy Structure

### Technical Skills

#### Programming Fundamentals
- **Variables and Data Types**: Declaration, initialization, type conversion
- **Control Structures**: Conditional statements, loops, switches
- **Functions and Methods**: Creation, parameters, return values, scope
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, lists, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues
- **Object-Oriented Concepts**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation

#### Language-Specific Proficiencies
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, closures
- **Python**: List comprehensions, generators, decorators
- **Java**: Thread management, exception handling, generics
- **C/C++**: Memory management, pointers, preprocessor directives
- **SQL**: Query optimization, joins, indexing

#### Software Engineering Practices
- **Version Control**: Branching, merging, conflict resolution
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, test-driven development
- **Performance Optimization**: Algorithmic efficiency, memory usage
- **Documentation**: Code comments, API documentation
- **Security Awareness**: Input validation, authentication concepts

### Problem-Solving Competencies

#### Analytical Thinking
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying reusable solutions
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms for specific problems
- **Complexity Analysis**: Understanding time and space efficiency

#### Development Approach
- **Iterative Development**: Incremental solution building
- **Debugging Methodology**: Systematic error identification
- **Refactoring Skills**: Code improvement without changing behavior
- **Optimization Strategy**: Identifying and resolving bottlenecks

## Challenge Mapping Framework

### Metadata Structure
Each challenge in KodeLab is tagged with:
- Primary skills (1-3 core competencies directly exercised)
- Secondary skills (supporting competencies indirectly practiced)
- Difficulty level within each skill dimension
- Prerequisite skills recommended before attempting

### Progression Mapping
- **Skill Trees**: Visual representation of skill dependencies
- **Mastery Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
- **Industry Alignment**: Mapping to job role requirements

## Learning Path Generation

### Path Components
- **Entry Assessment**: Determines starting point based on existing skills
- **Core Curriculum**: Essential skills for foundational competency
- **Specialization Branches**: Focused development in specific areas
- **Capstone Challenges**: Integrated problems requiring multiple skill areas

### Personalization Factors
- Performance on related challenges
- Learning pace and preferred difficulty curve
- Career or academic goals
- Identified skill gaps

## Implementation for Educators

### Course Design Tools
- Syllabus mapping to specific skills
- Challenge recommendation based on curriculum needs
- Skill gap analysis for class and individual students

### Progress Reporting
- Skill acquisition visualization
- Comparative analysis against learning objectives
- Mastery verification for academic records

## Industry Alignment

### Employer Skill Validation
- Regular review of taxonomy against industry requirements
- Employer contribution to skill definitions and importance
- Job role mapping to specific skill combinations

### Portfolio Integration
- Skill-based achievement certification
- Evidence collection for demonstrated competencies
- Exportable verification for employment applications
