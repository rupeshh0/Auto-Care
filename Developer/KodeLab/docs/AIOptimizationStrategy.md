# AI Cost Management Strategy

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for optimizing AI costs in the KodeLab platform while maintaining high-quality feedback. By implementing a tiered processing approach, feedback caching, and real-time cost monitoring, we project a 30-45% reduction in AI operational costs without compromising educational quality.

## 1. Tiered Processing Architecture

### 1.1 Model Hierarchy
Implement a three-tiered AI feedback system to balance cost and quality:

| Tier | Models | Usage | Est. Cost/1K tokens | Capabilities |
|------|--------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Tier 1** (Lightweight) | Fine-tuned GPT-3.5, Custom models | Initial screening, simple feedback, pattern recognition | $0.0005-$0.001 | Basic correctness, syntax issues, common patterns |
| **Tier 2** (Standard) | Base GPT-4, Claude Sonnet | Most feedback requests, complex syntax, patterns | $0.01-$0.03 | Detailed feedback, style improvement, optimization suggestions |
| **Tier 3** (Advanced) | GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Opus | Complex problems, novel approaches, senior-level feedback | $0.05-$0.12 | System design feedback, algorithm analysis, advanced security auditing |

### 1.2 Request Routing Logic

```python
def determine_model_tier(user_submission, task_complexity):
    """
    Routes feedback requests to appropriate model tier based on multiple factors
    """
    # Initial lightweight analysis
    complexity_score = analyze_submission_complexity(user_submission)
    user_tier = get_user_subscription_tier(user_id)
    submission_attempt = get_submission_attempt_number(user_id, task_id)
    
    # Route based on combined factors
    if submission_attempt == 1 or complexity_score < 3:
        return "tier1"
    elif complexity_score < 7 or task_complexity == "intermediate":
        return "tier2"
    elif user_tier == "premium" or task_complexity == "advanced":
        return "tier3"
    else:
        return "tier2"  # Default to middle tier
```

### 1.3 Progressive Deployment
- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2)**: Implement routing infrastructure, keeping 100% of traffic on Tier 2
- **Phase 2 (Month 3-4)**: Route 30% of applicable traffic to Tier 1, measure quality
- **Phase 3 (Month 5-6)**: Optimize routing rules, add Tier 3 for premium users
- **Phase 4 (Month 7+)**: Continuous optimization based on quality/cost metrics

## 2. Feedback Caching System

### 2.1 Similarity Detection Framework

Implement a vector-based similarity detection system to identify when new submissions are substantially similar to previously evaluated ones:

```python
def get_cached_feedback(submission_code, task_id):
    """
    Check if similar submissions have received feedback before
    """
    # Generate vector embedding of current submission
    current_embedding = generate_code_embedding(submission_code)
    
    # Retrieve potential matches from vector database
    potential_matches = vector_db.search(
        collection="submissions",
        query_vector=current_embedding,
        filter={"task_id": task_id},
        limit=5
    )
    
    # Check if any matches exceed similarity threshold
    for match in potential_matches:
        if calculate_similarity(current_embedding, match.embedding) > 0.92:
            return adapt_cached_feedback(match.feedback, submission_code)
    
    # No suitable cache hit
    return None
```

### 2.2 Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Time-based**: Cache entries expire after 30 days
- **Content-based**: Invalidate caches when task requirements are updated
- **Model-based**: Refresh caches when AI models are upgraded

### 2.3 Adaptation Layer
Apply lightweight transformations to cached feedback to personalize it for the current submission:

```python
def adapt_cached_feedback(cached_feedback, current_code):
    """
    Personalize cached feedback for the current submission
    """
    # Extract variable names, structural elements from current code
    code_elements = extract_code_elements(current_code)
    
    # Replace references in the cached feedback
    personalized_feedback = replace_code_references(cached_feedback, code_elements)
    
    # Add adaptation disclaimer
    personalized_feedback += "\n\n_This feedback has been adapted from similar submissions while maintaining accuracy._"
    
    return personalized_feedback
```

## 3. Real-time Cost/Performance Dashboard

### 3.1 Metrics Tracking
Track the following metrics in real-time:

| Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Update Frequency |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Cost** | Cost per token, Cost per feedback, Daily total, Weekly trend | Real-time |
| **Performance** | Response time, Feedback quality rating, User satisfaction | Hourly |
| **Usage** | Requests per model, Token usage distribution, Cache hit rate | Real-time |
| **Quality** | User feedback ratings, Feedback implementation rate, Task completion rate | Daily |

### 3.2 Alert System
Implement automated alerts based on the following triggers:
- Cost spike exceeding 30% of daily average
- Sustained quality rating drop below 4.2/5
- Cache hit rate falling below expected threshold
- Model availability or performance degradation

### 3.3 Dashboard Design

The dashboard will feature:
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Cost breakdown by model tier and task category  
- Quality metrics correlated with cost efficiency
- Trend analysis with recommendation engine
- Anomaly detection with root cause analysis tools

## 4. Model Rotation Strategy

### 4.1 Performance/Cost Ratio Monitoring
Calculate a continuous efficiency score for each model:

```python
def calculate_model_efficiency(model_id, time_period="24h"):
    """
    Calculate efficiency score based on cost and performance
    """
    # Gather metrics
    avg_quality_rating = get_avg_quality_rating(model_id, time_period)
    avg_cost_per_feedback = get_avg_cost_per_feedback(model_id, time_period)
    response_time = get_avg_response_time(model_id, time_period)
    
    # Normalize factors (higher is better)
    quality_score = avg_quality_rating / 5.0  # 0-1 scale
    cost_score = 1 - (avg_cost_per_feedback / max_acceptable_cost)  # 0-1 scale
    speed_score = 1 - (response_time / max_acceptable_time)  # 0-1 scale
    
    # Calculate weighted efficiency score
    efficiency_score = (
        quality_score * 0.5 +
        cost_score * 0.3 +
        speed_score * 0.2
    )
    
    return efficiency_score
```

### 4.2 Automatic Failover
Implement automatic model rotation based on:
- Availability (unavailable models trigger immediate failover)
- Response time (slow responses trigger temporary rotation)
- Cost fluctuations (price increases beyond threshold trigger evaluation)

### 4.3 A/B Testing Framework
Continuously evaluate model performance through automated A/B testing:
- Allocate 5% of traffic to model candidates
- Evaluate based on quality metrics and cost efficiency
- Graduate successful models to production
- Automated reporting on test results

## 6. Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Current | Target (6 months) | Target (12 months) |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Average cost per feedback | $0.12 | $0.08 (↓33%) | $0.06 (↓50%) |
| Cache hit rate | 0% | 20% | 35% |
| Quality rating | 4.3/5 | 4.4/5 | 4.5/5 |
| Cost predictability | High variance | ±15% monthly | ±10% monthly |

## 7. Monitoring and Optimization

The AI Cost Management Strategy will be reviewed monthly with the following process:
1. Comprehensive metric review meeting
2. Identification of optimization opportunities
3. Adjustment of routing algorithms and thresholds
4. Update of cost/quality targets

This system will allow KodeLab to maintain high-quality AI feedback while establishing predictable and optimized operational costs, ensuring long-term sustainability as the platform scales.
