## Unrealistic or Unclear Metrics

Some projections may be overly optimistic and should be revised:

1. **User Growth Rate**: The projection of going from 0 to 22,500 free users and 4,800 premium users in Year 1 may be aggressive without a detailed user acquisition strategy.

2. **Conversion Rate**: The target conversion rate increase from 6.5% to 11% in 24 months should be validated with market research.

3. **Cost per Token**: The documentation doesn't specify clear AI model token costs, which is essential for accurate financial forecasting given the platform's reliance on AI feedback.

4. **Feedback Cost per User**: There's no clear breakdown of the expected AI token consumption per user per month, making it difficult to calculate the variable cost per user for the AI feedback feature.

5. **Operating Margin**: The projection of going from -25% in Year 1 to 32% in Year 3 is a significant change that requires clearer justification.
